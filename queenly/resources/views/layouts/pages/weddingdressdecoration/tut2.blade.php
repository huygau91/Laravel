<h1>Tutorial 2. Step-by-Step Embroidery Techniques.</h1>
<p></p>
<p><strong>In this tutorial I would like to show you the variety of options for embroidering wedding and evening garments with different decoration materials: long and short bugle beads, seed beads, and mixed materials.</strong> </p>
<p>
<img src="https://corsetacademy.s3.amazonaws.com/decoration/1/Tutorial%202_files/image002.jpg" class="img-responsive center-block" alt="col-020 v:shapes=" _x0420__x0438__x0441__x0443__x043d__x043e__x043a__x0020_21"=""></p>
<p><strong>Example 1.</strong> What you see here are short bugle beads sewn on with gaps in-between. I pick up a bead, bring the needle down, and bring it out 1mm below the previous stitch. Then I pick up another bead, bring the needle down, bring it out, string the next bead, etc. You get the point.</p>
<p><strong>Example 2.</strong> Here I have used longer bugle beads framed in seed beads. I pick up a seed bead, a bugle bead, and another seed bead, and bring the needle down. I bring the needle back up at a small distance. And again: I pick up a seed bead, a bugle bead, and another seed bead, bring the needle down, etc. You can basically embroider such lines in any direction: they will settle down nicely. For example, you might want to use them to highlight the contour of a motif.</p>
<p><strong>Example 3.</strong> This is a stem stitch version with pearl beads. I pick up a pearl bead and five seed beads on the needle and bring the needle down. And then again: a pearl bead, five seed beads, etc. Every time the needle comes up next to the middle of the previous stitch and in the same direction. If I need to embroider a curved line and not a straight line (think an outline of a leaf), then I simply keep bringing the needle down with a turn in correspondence with the shape of the motif. And I always bring the needle out next to the middle of the previous stitch, regardless of the direction. The direction of the row of stitches depends on where the needle enters the fabric. </p>
<p><strong>Examples 4, 5, and 6.</strong> These are wide-spaced stitches with larger and smaller pearl beads and faceted beads. These types of beads are produced by various manufacturers. Quite nice beads are made in the Czech Republic. Swarovski are the most beautiful and expensive kind. You have a very wide range to choose from: large and small beads with different faceting styles. AB beads look particularly great on wedding garments. They are clear and iridescent and match any dress. </p>
<p><strong>Example 7.</strong> This is another stem stitch version based on the same principle: the needle comes out next to the middle of the previous stitch. The only difference is the sequence: a seed bead, a larger bead, and another seed bead. The stitches are diagonal. If I need to change the direction, then I keep bring the needle down with a turn corresponding to the shape of the motif and bringing it out next to the middle of the previous stitch regardless of the direction. This allows you to arrange the stitches in the desired direction with respect to the motif. When the curved area of the contour you are embroidering comes to its end and you need to pass onto the next curved area, don't try to turn the same row of stitches in a new direction but start a new row instead. On any motif, I always find a convex line and start from it. </p>
<p><strong>Let me illustrate the rules of embroidering a curved line with stem stitches.</strong> </p>
<p>
<img src="https://corsetacademy.s3.amazonaws.com/decoration/1/Tutorial%202_files/image004.jpg" class="img-responsive center-block"></p>
<p>As you can see in the picture below, the edge of the piece has a rather complicated shape. I prefer dividing it in separate sections instead of making a single uninterrupted row of stitches along the entire contour. <strong>I divide it in three sections: 1, 2, and 3. </strong>I will make a row of stitches in different directions on each section. </p>
<p><strong>Section 1</strong> is a convex line and I move from left to right always bring the needle down from the outer side. I make the first, the second, and then the third stitch and so on until I reach the section 2. </p>
<p>I need to work on <strong>section 2</strong> as if it were another convex line and not a concave line. In my imagination, I swap the motif and the empty space in the picture above and stitch from left to right as if along a convex line. I try to fully cover the edge with seed beads or whatever accessories I am using. Eventually, I reach the beginning of section 1. </p>
<p><strong>Section 3</strong> is embroidered the same way as section 1: from left to right following the convex line. When making the first stitch, the needle enters the fabric at a 2mm distance from the edge. The rest of the stitches are sewn the same way from left to right down to the very end. </p>
<p><strong>Therefore, I can embroider a very neat contour by splitting it into several sections. It will look smooth and you won't be able to tell where the ends of the sections meet.</strong> If I had tried to make an uninterrupted row of stitches, I would have had to make a turn between sections 1 and 2 and follow the concave line. The stitches would have been uneven because it is really hard to embroider a concave line. When you are embroidering a convex line, the stitches settle down nicely and form a neat even row. </p>
<p><strong>Example 8.</strong> This row of stem stitches is made from long bugle beads following the same principle as in example 2 where long bugle beads are arranged in a straight line. Only this time it is made with a shift to resemble stairs. If the needle comes out somewhat below the middle of the previous stitch, it will make the row look thicker. If that's the effect you wish to achieve, then it's the best way to do it. </p>
<p><strong>Example 9.</strong> It's a regular row of stem stitches with six seed beads in each one. You can do the same with short bugle beads (<strong>Example 10</strong>). The same kind of rows can be made from long bugle beads or plain beads or any other materials - and they will look different each time! Combining beads of two colors broadens the range of possible design options: you might not even be able to tell from a distance how exactly such embroidery was made even though it is made of regular rows of stem stitches. You can easily embroider a curved line this way: it will turn in the direction in which you bring the needle down. </p>
<p><strong>Example 11.</strong> This option is a combination of different materials. I have used long and short bugle beads. If you choose beads of two matching colors for your dress (for example, a white dress with silver embroidery or silver lace), then your bead embroidery will sparkle in a beautiful way without standing out too much. It will sparkle in a very elegant way. And it's exactly what we want! Seed beads and short bugle beads are particularly good in creating such beautiful effects.</p>
<p><strong>Example 12.</strong> It's a version with traditional seed beads. There are five seed beads in each stitch, which makes it about 7mm long. I bring the needle down 2mm below the beginning of the previous stitch. It makes the row look more delicate and yet gives it more volume. You can use this method if you prefer thicker, more pronounced stitches. </p>
<p><strong>Example 13.</strong> Here each stitch is a pearl bead framed in short bugle beads. You pick them up, bring the needle down, bring it back up, and then pick up another short bugle bead, pearl bead, and short bugle bead. </p>
<p><strong>Example 14.</strong> It's a classic row of stem stitches with Japanese short bugle beads. Note how different all versions look even though the technique remains the same. </p>
<p><strong>Example 15.</strong> These are twisted long bugle beads. Unlike regular long bugle beads, they have a particular kind of shine: I would say it is more noticeable on the garment. If you notice that the ends of your bugle beads are too sharp and may tear the thread, then it's a good idea to put a round bead at each end of the bugle bead. It will protect the thread from tearing and give the embroidery a more sophisticated look.</p>
<p><strong>I embroider a row of stem stitches using twisted long bugle beads.</strong> Please note how at the turn I bring the needle out next to the middle of the previous stitch and from the outer side of it. </p>

<p><strong>When the turn is supposed to go sharper, I step 1mm down from the middle of the previous stitch. </strong>&nbsp;This trick allows you to make sharper turns following the contour. It works particularly well with long bugle beads because they don't bend (unlike strands of seed beads). I make the turn sharper by stepping down from the middle of the previous stitch. </p>

<p><strong>The next combination is seed bead - faceted bead - seed bead. The thing about this combination is</strong> that large pearl beads or faceted beads placed in the middle of the stitch prevent it from bending (just like long bugle beads). <strong>To make a sharp turn,</strong> I bring the needle out from the outer side of the previous stitch and closer to its end - next to about 2/3 of it. If the central bead is large, you can bring the needle out even closer to the end of the previous stitch. In my case, it comes out at about the level of the seed bead. This makes a neat and smooth turn.</p>

<p><strong>The next combination is seed bead - long bugle bead - seed bead.</strong> The row is made just the same way as the twisted long bugle bead version. If you need to make a turn, you simply bring the needle out next to the middle of the previous stitch. And if you need to make a sharp turn, you step 1mm down from the middle of previous stitch, from the outer side of it. The seed beads prevent the bugle beads from tearing the thread with their sharp edges.</p>

<p></p>
<p><strong>And now another combination: a pearl bead and six seed beads.</strong> These are classic stem stitches where the needle comes out next to the middle of the previous stitch. The same algorithm is used for embroidering stitches with plain seed beads. The stitch easily bends when made of a row of seed beads. There is nothing difficult about this version. It works just as well with any large beads instead of pearl beads, as well as with seed beads alone.</p>

<p><strong>The next stitch is made of one seed bead and one long bugle bead</strong>. I have chosen hexagon seed beads and Japanese long bugle beads. Here, if you want to make a sharp turn, you bring the needle out stepping 1mm down from the middle of the previous stitch. If you need to make a simple turn, you follow the traditional stem stitch technique: bring the needle out next to the middle of the previous stitch, right below it. </p>

<p><strong>There are three types of stem stitch rows in the picture below. All of them are made with stitches of the same length and material (five seed beads):</strong> </p>

<p><strong>You can safely use versions 1 and 2. What concerns version 3, I strongly recommend against using it due to certain characteristic features of hexagon seed beads. </strong></p>
<p><strong>Version 1</strong> makes the thinnest braid. There are five seed beads in the stitch and the needle comes out right next to the middle of the previous stitch. </p>

<p><strong>Version 2</strong> makes a somewhat thicker braid. The needle comes out next to about 2/3 of the previous stitch which makes more pronounced stitches and a thicker row. </p>

<p><strong>Versions 1 and 2</strong> are used depending on how much space you need to fill in and what effect you want to achieve. </p>
<p><strong>Version 3 is represented by transversal stitches. Let me explain why I don't recommend using it.</strong> </p>

<p>There is the same amount of beads (five) in the stitches of all three versions. But since hexagon seed beads produce the best shine along the vertical axis, the row does not look very neat when made of horizontal, transversal stitches. It looks as though all stitches had different lengths. And the beads simply don't look as impressive because they shine better vertically than horizontally.&nbsp; I have come across this problem many times before and I just cannot recommend it. You could only use it for filling in individual areas. Rows of vertically arranged stitches are much better for lines and contours.</p>
